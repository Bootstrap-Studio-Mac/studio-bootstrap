## 🧠 What is Bootstrap Studio?

**Bootstrap Studio** is a premium **desktop application** for **creating responsive websites and web applications** using the popular Bootstrap framework. Whether you're a seasoned web developer or a beginner designer, Bootstrap Studio helps you build sleek, production-ready websites without writing every line of code from scratch.

The application comes with a beautiful, intuitive interface that allows you to **drag and drop components** (like headers, navbars, cards, buttons, forms) into your project. Everything you design is based on **Bootstrap’s clean HTML/CSS/JS structure**, making it responsive by default and easy to export.

You can write custom CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, and even integrate third-party libraries. The **live preview** feature helps you see changes instantly. It also includes **smart editing**, **real-time preview**, **auto-suggestion**, and **support for Bootstrap 5**, which allows developers to create modern UIs with minimal friction.

Whether you're creating a one-page site, a startup landing page, or a full-fledged web app, Bootstrap Studio offers the tools to get there — all packed into a lightweight and efficient IDE.
